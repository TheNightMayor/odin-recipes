summary: basic html refresher including image search, hyperlinks, and uploading to github
results: successfully linked three pages to index page. lists, image, links all seem to work.
notes: had to look up how to use git/github again. used colon instead of equals incorrectly for link. still figuring out how to easil navigate VScode
